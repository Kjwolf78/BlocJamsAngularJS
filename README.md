## Bloc Frontend Project Starter

A starter application for student projects in Bloc's [Frontend Web Development Course](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp).

Bloc Jams is the music player similar to iTunes and others of its kind, I developed via the Bloc Front End Web Developer program. This is the main project I built, which taught me how to code from basic HTML to AngularJS and how each language truly has its own identity. This version was originally created in Javascript then to JQuery and finalized in AngularJS.
